<h1>Insurance Dataset in Pycaret</h1>
<p>This repository contains the Insurance Dataset from Kaggle, which has been preprocessed and analyzed using Pycaret, an open-source, low-code machine learning library in Python. The goal of this project is to provide a quick and easy example of how to use Pycaret for data preprocessing, model training, and model selection on a real-world dataset.</p>
<h2>Dataset Information</h2>
<p>The Insurance Dataset contains information about individuals who have purchased insurance, including their age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region, as well as the charges that they paid for insurance.</p>
<p>The dataset consists of 1,338 rows and 7 columns.</p>
<h2>Project Setup</h2>
<p>To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pycaret</li>
<li>Pandas</li>
<li>Matplotlib</li>
<li>Seaborn</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>To run this project, simply open the Jupyter notebook Insurance_Regression_20210214.ipynb&nbsp;and run the cells. The notebook contains code for loading and preprocessing the dataset, as well as for training and evaluating several different machine learning models using Pycaret.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>After analyzing the Insurance Dataset using Pycaret, we found that the Gradient Boosting Regressor model provided the best performance on this dataset, achieving an R-squared score of 0.83 on the test set.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, the Insurance Dataset provides a great example of how to use Pycaret for data preprocessing and machine learning on a real-world dataset. With just a few lines of code, Pycaret makes it easy to preprocess the data, train multiple machine learning models, and select the best model for the task at hand.</p>
